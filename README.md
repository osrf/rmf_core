# rmf\_core


We have migrated the development of the Robotics Middleware Framework (RMF) to a dedicated organization, [open-rmf](https://github.com/open-rmf).

The core packages here have been split up into several repositories
* [rmf_battery](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_battery)
* [rmf_task](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_task)
* [rmf_traffic](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_traffic)
* [rmf_utils](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_utils)
* [rmf_internal_msgs](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_internal_msgs)
* [rmf_ros2](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_ros2)

More instructions on setting up RMF and running demonstrations can be found [here](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf).
