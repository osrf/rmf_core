# rmf\_fleet\_adapter package

This package contains the various fleet adapter nodes for different levels of control. Using specific messages from `rmf_fleet_msgs`, it communicates with proprietary fleet drivers and managers through ROS2.

## Note,

* The current implementation is mainly a migration of `proto_fleet_adapter` from the `rmf_traffic_ros2` package.
