  ///
  /// \param[in] map_name
  ///   The name of the reference map that the position is on.
  ///
  /// \param[in] position
  ///   A position along the robot's path where it will (or can) have zero
  ///   instantaneous velocity. This will usually be a point where the robot
  ///   needs to turn, or a point that comes before an intersection, so the
  ///   robot can come to a stop and allow other vehicles to pass. This is a 2D
  ///   heterogeneous vector. The first two elements refer to translational
  ///   (x,y) position while the third element is a yaw value in radians.
  ///
  /// \param[in] mandatory_delay
  ///   A delay that the robot is expected to experience once it arrives at
  ///   this waypoint. Usually this will be caused by the robots needing to
  ///   wait for doors to open or lifts to arrive.
  ///
  /// \param[in] yield
  ///   Whether or not the robot can wait at this point. If yield is false, then
  ///   the planner will assume that it cannot ask the robot to wait here. If
  ///   yield is true, then the planner may request that the robot wait here to
  ///   avoid conflicts with other traffic participants.
